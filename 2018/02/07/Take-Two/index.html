<p>Well Friends, It’s been awhile since I have posted. While my intention had been to document along the way for my inaugural Whole 30 journey, sometimes life has a way of jumping in with a big ‘Ol intention adjustment. So I have good news, and I have bad news. We will start with the good news- I did it! I tackled Whole 30 and I ROCKED THAT SHIT!!!! Anyone who has been through it will know the pride involved that calls for the screaming capital letters. The food tasted good, it made my body feel good (minus the sugar withdrawl period)- the program was good. During the 30 days I had to tackle a pretty intense period in my life. My Grandfather became ill. While I can’t lie to you and say that my emotions weren’t screaming for me to comfort them with cake, cookies, and multiple bottles of wine, I didn’t cave. In fact, during a time period that was filled with so much sadness and unknown, I actually found comfort in following through with Whole 30. It was almost like it was the one thing I could grab onto and control in a world that was filled with so much that was out of my control. After a few weeks spent visiting Grandpa in the hospital, he was eventually transferred to hospice and passed away. While I continue to miss him terribly, I take comfort in knowing he was surrounded in love with his family by his side in his last moments. And yes, we did pack our own shredded pork with salad and guacamole for the funeral luncheon. I know my need for control can drive my hubby and those I love crazy at times, but for Whole 30, it proved to be the winning attribute I needed. We wrapped up on October 31st -Halloween. Which brings me to the bad news….Our last day was on Halloween. Which meant that on November 1st, we had a bucket of candy sitting on our counter top. I held strong for a few days to try and slowly reintroduce foods back in my diet. At some point, the Snickers siren song became too strong. I caved. And when I caved, I caved hard. The glowing skin, happy gut and inches lost were soon abandoned to the sugar demons I had fought so hard in those first few days of the Whole 30 program. Since my fall from healthy food grace, I have tried different tactics to get back on track. I would be successful for a few days, maybe a week, and then I would fall right back into the same crap food rut. I feel sluggish, I feel bloated, and my pants don’t fit. Desperate times call for desperate measures. And that, my friends, is why I am jumping on the Whole 30 band wagon again. I want this….I NEED this. I need to get some control back. I am not going to lie- I am nervous. I am fearful of failing. I am worried about how much this might suck. And while I am ashamed to admit it, I am going to miss my friends- sugar, gluten and alcohol. I know what I want my life to look like though, and the unhealthy relationship with food is not what I see when I picture my future. Join me as I clean out those cupboards again and dive into another Whole 30 journey- Take two!</p>
